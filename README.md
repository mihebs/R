# Dashboard: first project in R
Hi, guys! This repository contains my first project developed in the Applied Mathematics course. It's a Dashboard application, developed in R.

During the construction of the dashboard, we used libraries and functions for data manipulation and transformation, creation of charts/tables and visualizations, obtaining real-time stock data.
